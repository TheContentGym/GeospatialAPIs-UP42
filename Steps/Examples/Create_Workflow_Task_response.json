The constellation is highly reactive and has been designed for daily revisit anywhere on Earth,  with stereo and tri-stereo capacity.\n\nThe block provides Pléiades data in its original DIMAP format clipped to the provided AOI. The datasets are using geographic coordinates (EPSG:4326) and can be processed with the Data Format and Type conversion block or by specialised GIS/Remote Sensing Software. The available output bands of the Pléiades block are: red, green, blue, NIR (2m resolution) and panchromatic (0.5 m resolution). This block has a special feature: it is possible to order (and pay for) the data once and then run workflows using this data as often as needed. It is also possible to make a reliable data cost estimation using the Test Query feature.\n\n**Note:** This is an *Analytic* imagery product that returns 4 bands (RGB, NIR) with 12 bits. Many analytics blocks cannot process the output of this block directly but need it to be pre-processed using the Pan-sharpening (UP42) block. Please check the corresponding block descriptions if they explicitly state that they can handle this type of data.\n\n**Technical information**\n\n|Feature|Info|\n|:-|:-|\n|Archive date / refresh frequency | Archives available starting from 2016, and from 2013 over the main urban areas. Yearly acquisitions over the +300.000 inhabitants urban areas. All 0.5m resolution images acquired every day by Airbus worldwide (with 30° incidence angle, max. 15% cloud cover in Regular Area, and max. 25% cloud cover in Difficult Area).|\n|Frequency bands | Panchromatic: 0.470-0.830 µm / Blue: 0.430-0.550 µm / Green: 0.500-0.620 µm / Red: 0.590-0.710 µm / Near Infrared: 0.740-0.940 µm|\n|Resolution|Panchromatic: 0.5m / Multispectral: 2m / Swath: 20km at nadir|\n|Processing level|Ortho Bundle 12bits Reflectance JPEG2000 (Level3)|\n|Data format| JPEG2000 & DIMAP format|\n\n**Use cases**\n\nFor more information about potential use cases, see the [use cases gallery](https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/en/6987-case-study-gallery-results?products_services=2404).\n\n**Viewing imagery**\n\nPléiades Download block returns JPEG2000 & DIMAP format. To view it, open the DIMAP file or use the [DIMAP -> GeoTIFF Conversion](https://marketplace.up42.com/block/c94bb4cd-8ee2-40df-ba76-d332b8f48c6a) or [Pan-sharpening SPOT/Pléiades](https://marketplace.up42.com/block/903f0435-d638-475e-bbe9-53b5664a22a8) blocks to produce GeoTIFF files. Do not open the JPEG2000 files directly as these may be geometrically transformed.\n\n**License**\n\n**Internal Use**: For customers who are using this block to perform their daily operations, and keep the dataset and all derivatives for internal use only.\n\n**Streaming vs. Download**: This block is a Download block which allows downloading or storing the original images, and not only the analytics results. This [page](https://docs.up42.com/going-further/download-blocks-tutorial-spot-pleiades.html) describes the differences in more detail.\n\n**More information**\n\nFor more information, please visit the
