## About This Document

This document gives you step-by-step instructions to process a territory on earth using the **UP42 APIs** to:

- Analyze the territory for a particular time \ `[QuestionToSME: What type of analysis? The PDF spec doesn't say.]`
- Analyze and compare the same territory for two different time durations to compare and find out the changes taking place in an area

### Use Case Area 
This guide uses the UP42 APIs and the following area as an example geospatial dataset to analyze:

- A coastal area of Taormina in Sicily, Italy: (https://gist.github.com/up42-epicycles/66b8d8f8cc196b645897b8f9302fe16d)
### What This Document Is Not?
- An API reference
- A document to be freely circulated to the UP42 users `[QuestionToSME: some real project and job IDs are there in the doc - hopefully it is OK and no one else can utilize this information without authorization.]`
- Complete - there are queries embedded in some places with QuestionToSME: tags.
